# read two files;

# compare the cds sequences


# read the first file - the source of truth; create the necessary objects or assess against the data base?
# need to add a section to the database to record the location of the actual gene.

# read the second file; the output of prodigal or genemark and then see if any of the gene locations match up.

# Check location -> if this location is wrong this is most likely an error.
# Check translation for somewhat of a match


# what scores should be used? what assertion of success is there?
