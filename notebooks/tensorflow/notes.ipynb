    "It is currently unclear the next mapping / transformation which needs to occur, this probably needs to be some sort of distance calculation. \n",
    "However, this distance is a fundamental issue - what is an ortholog? this is a contextual definition - it is dependent upon what is surronding it.\n",
    "this i suppose is a really good thing to talk about. Despite being annoying.\n",
    "\n",
    "A potential idea is to find a case where sequence similarity is done using machine learning; and then subsequently applying this to genes after extracting them from prodigal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mapping can be extended to account for other values, like 'R' which may be beneficial.\n"
