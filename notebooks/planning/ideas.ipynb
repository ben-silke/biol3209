    "\n",
    "1. This has the potential that a large number of false negatives are found. What is the actual likelihood that the CDS regions are of the exact same length? Therefore the sample space is decreased rapidly and very significantly. Proteins may differ in size by 5-10 amin acids; there 15-30 bps. This means that this restriction may simply be too much.\n",
    "2. The amino acid ratio may not take into account the bp content of different species. Some species may be more GC rich and therefore could be additionally excluded in this calculation.\n",
    "3. A dinucleotide ratio does not acutally inform the protein content. The redundancy of the genetic code means it may be better to determine proteins based upon the actual amino acid produced by a codon.\n",
    "4. The program does not appear to take into account the fact the direction of the sequence upon entry. In true metagenomic samples; the direction of the sequence is unknown. In other words; which sample is actually being looked at. This can affect the ratio. E.g. is TA a true TA or is it an AT from another direction?\n",
    "    4.1. This acutally may be considered because there are 16 dinucleotides which are used.\n",
    "5. The program does not seem to take into account rRNA or tRNA genes.\n",
    "    5.1. I expect that these are regions which are CDS (ATG-...-TAG) but it does not seem to pick up. The alternative is that the program uses prior annotated sequenes. This also represents issues because then you have to manuall annotate the sequences.\n"
